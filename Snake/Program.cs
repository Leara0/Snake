/*
 * Suggested Changes from Brett
 * - add music
 * - make snake (caterpillar??) into an array
 * - make a pause screen? add instructions for how to pause if desired
 * - add ascii animation of snake/caterpillar
 * X changed snake print to for loop so you can color change the caterpillar
 * X add in unicode characters
 * - obstacles
 *
 * my idea:
 * - red AND green apples, worth different points and maybe have both on screen at the same time.
 * Maybe red apples are closer to the edges??
 *
 * MAKE IT WORK WITH SMALLER CONSOLE
